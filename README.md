# Project Jotter

<b>Project jotter</b> is a website for writing first plans for projects
of all sorts.

## Contributing

Clone the project and create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

## Oddities

SVG template files use the `.html` file extension because this gives
more consistent syntax highlighting, given that they are used as
inline SVGs.
