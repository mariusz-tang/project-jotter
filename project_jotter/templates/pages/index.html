            <p class="body-text panel panel-secondary">The tool is completely free to use for any purpose, and you can export your plans to JSON format if this is helpful to you.</p>
            <p class="body-text panel">You can share your plans with anyone, but note that this is not intended as a full-blown project management application. It is for the quick drafts or notes you might make before committing to a project.</p>
